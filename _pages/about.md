My name is Kelsey Fontenot. Currently, I am a senior at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Controls, Instrumentation, and Robotics. I will be graduating in May 2026.

I currently do research with the Accelerated Materials Laboratory for Sustainability, supervised by post-doc Aleks Siemmen and Principal Investigator Tonio Buonassisi. [more research stuff?]

In my free time, I like to go to the movies, rock climb, and play ultimate frisbee. [more here?]
