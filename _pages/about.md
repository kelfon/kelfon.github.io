My name is Kelsey Fontenot. Currently, I am a senior at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Controls, Instrumentation, and Robotics. I will be graduating in May 2026.

I currently do research with the Accelerated Materials Laboratory for Sustainability, supervised by post-doc Aleks Siemmen and Principal Investigator Tonio Buonassisi. I'm passionate about working on all parts of robotics - mechanical, electrical, and software!

Outside of lab, I am usually staying active (fencing, playing ultimate frisbee, rock climbing to name a few), watching a movie at the closest AMC, or reading classic literature.
