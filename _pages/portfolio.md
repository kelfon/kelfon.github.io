## Scribbly
2.009 Product Engineering Process, Fall 2025

[product sheet](https://www.009cycles.com/products/red-product-sheet.pdf)
Scribbly is a user-friendly embroidery pattern printer that draws directly onto multiple types of fabric (ie. denim, cotton, polyester) with our custom software that converts .png, .jpg, or .svg images into g-code. I led and managed a 15 person team as a System Integrator to design, manufacture, and construct our product prototype in only 8 weeks.

## Recycling Robot Bottle Sorting
2.12 Introduction to Robotics, Spring 2025

Our final project was centered on landfills with a focus on sorting bottles on a conveyor belt into correct bins. I collaborated with another student to design our team’s custom controller for the Universal Robot 5 arm and to develop the path plans for picking and placing the different colored and different shaped bottles. 

## Lobster Pot Retrieval ROV
2.017 Design of Electromechanical Robotic Systems, Spring 2025

Our semester long project centered on designing and developing an underwater robot that could locate, semiautonomously navigate towards, and retrieve abandoned crab and lobster pots from the sea floor. I worked on the Navigation subteam and designed a PID controller for our underwater robot to autonomously navigate toward an abandoned lobster pot so the pot can be retrieved. 

## Optimizing Aluminum Honeycomb Area for Race Car Safety
2.671 Measurement and Instrumentation, Fall 2024

[paper](/files/671_paper_2column.pdf)
I tested aluminum honeycomb structures via axial loading and developed a model relating the structure’s volume to the energy it absorbed as well as the peak and average forces the structure withstood over a set distance. I applied this model to my build team MIT Motorsports to influence design choices of the impact attenuator with the goal of minimizing size while maintaining safety of the car in accordance with the rules of the FSAE competition.

2.S007 Design & Manufacturing I: Autonomous Machines

I designed, manufactured, and programmed a wheeled autonomous robot for a gameboard competition. My robot focused on simplicity of design and ease of switch into autonomous mode with the goal of moving a weighted ball up a ramp and into a pit to maximize points gained through autonomous actions.
